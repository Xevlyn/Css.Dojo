<!--
    These are notes

    Flexbox always has a direction and by default this direction is horizontal 

    for when the direction is in row:

    the main axis goes from left to right horizontally

    the cross axis goes from top to bottom  vertically

    for when the direction is in column:

    the main axis goes from top to bottom vertically

    the cross axis goes from left to right horizontally


    The default direction is the row direction
