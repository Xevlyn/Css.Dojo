<!--
    These are notes

    Making the containers div children to be responsive

    This will enable the items to grow and shrink with the container when a change is made to it. 

    the property is flex 

    flex is the short hand for the following properties

    flex-grow 
    flex-shrink
    flex-basis
    
    if another ite is included later on,
    flex automatically allocates space for that item to be included in.

    We can also target specific items by making them grow ,ore than the other items around it

    items located in a container should be referenced to the container they are in else it won't work.
