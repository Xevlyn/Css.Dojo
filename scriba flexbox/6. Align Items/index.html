<!--
    These are notes

    This is for control across the cross axis

    setting the height of the container which contains items will cause the items to stretch according to the height of the container.

    This stretches regardless of the browser orientation

    This will only be possible if the the container and body heights are 100% else it wouldn't work.
    Important to note here that the height of the body hasn't been set to 100%,
    But its still streches to which I don't have an explaination to.

    Align has the following behavioural properties

    flex-start
    flex-end
    center
    stretch
    basline

    flexbox is great for centering an item inside of a container.

    Now for targetting specific items 

    align-self + <behavioral property>

    align-content properties

    flex-start
    flex-end
    center
    stretch
    space-between
    space-around
