<!--
    These are notes

    the default direction is row 

    doing the flex-direction: column

    will cause the justify-content to no longer have the ability to control the stack across the horizontal line,
    but instead will control the stack across the vertical line

    Given the entire container has been filled
    the height hasn't been specified so editing won't show.

    Again remeber to set the height of the html and body to 100%.

    still doesn't apply here and I can't explain why
