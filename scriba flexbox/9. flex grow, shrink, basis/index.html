<!--
    These are notes

    the flex property has 3 values

    flex-grow - This makes the items grow with the width of the container. How much of the extra space should be distributed to the items.
    flex-shrink - The min size when reduced.
    flex-basis - this sets the base width of the container its appointed to.

    of which when the flex property is used, it is a shorthand for the 3

    concept of margin value placeent applies here meaning

    flex: 1;

    actually means 

    flex-grow:1;
    flex-shrink:1;
    flex-basis:0; - 0 is the default here thats why.
